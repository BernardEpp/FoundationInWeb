/*
BEST PRACTICES

1. Add 'use strict'; to the top of every file and IIFE.
2. Do not use var - us elet or const instead. Prefer const.
3. Naming - use camelCase for variables, functions, etc. use PascalCase for classes.
4. Use IIFE's whenever it makes sense - it almost always makes sense.
5. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
6. Use a separate file for your JavaScript.
7. Use semi-colons.
8. Don't Assume.
